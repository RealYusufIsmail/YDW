# YDW
YDW (Yusuf's Discord Wrapper) My own Discord Wrapper inspired by others such as JDA and Javacord

This is for learning purposes, i have not other purpose.


Note: I have used some code from JDA so all credit goes for them.

These include:
<br>
Inspiration for the websocket and CloseCode.
<br>
Inspiration for event adapter. Handle event system was built alone.
<br>
some other minor methods such as gateway ping.


This project use java 17.
