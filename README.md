# YDW
YDW (Yusuf's Discord Wrapper) My own Discord Wrapper inspired by others such as JDA.


Note: I have used some code from JDA so all credit goes for them.

These include:
Inspiration for the websocket and CloseCode.
Inspiration for event adapter. Handle event system was built alone.
some other minor methods such as gateway ping.


This project use java 17.
